# Quora Post – RESTful CRUD App

## 📌 Project Overview
Quora Post – RESTful CRUD Project is a web application built using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS that demonstrates the implementation of RESTful architecture and CRUD operations. The application allows users to create, view, edit, update, and delete posts through structured routes using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE.

Each post is assigned a unique ID using UUID, enabling dynamic handling of individual posts. The project uses EJS templates for server-side rendering and shared CSS styling across multiple pages. It focuses on understanding backend fundamentals including Express routing, middleware usage, dynamic parameters, and REST API design.
